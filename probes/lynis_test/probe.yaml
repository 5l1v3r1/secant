description: >
 Lynis is a tool that checks a number of security characteristics of the
 machine. The probe runs the Lynis command and returns the results. The
 outcome isn't interpreted and sometimes may suggest precautions that are out
 of scope for the purpose of the tested machine. The machine must enable remote
 access in order to run the probe.
