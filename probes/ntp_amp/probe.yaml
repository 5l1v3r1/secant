title: Check the NTP server can't be abused for DDoS amplification attacks.
description: >
 Certain configurations of the NTP service makes it possible for the attacker
 to mount an amplification attack that greatly increases the efficiency of the
 attack. Since the traffic originates from the NTP server it might hit badly
 the service owner. The probe checks that the risky configuration is not
 available to the Internet.
